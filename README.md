Sound-Reactive-LED-MEMs-Microphone-Prop
========================================

Modified example code from the [Interactive LED Music Visualizer](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/interactive-led-music-visualizer/all). This code uses the MEMs microphone instead of the Sound Detector. It's not as fast since the code needs to take a sample of the audio and processes the DC offset audio signal. While the code isn't as efficient as using the Sound Detector's envelope pin, the code is sufficient enough.
